	&nbsp; <span style="font-family: Verdana;">AIESEC United States recognizes and is concerned with the issues of alcohol misuse on college campuses across the country and at AIESEC events.&nbsp; We are concerned with the health and safety of college students, the relationship between our local committees and their sponsoring colleges and universities and the potential damage to AIESEC&#39;s positive reputation.&nbsp; In an effort to promote a responsible attitude toward alcohol, AIESEC United States is adopting the following Policy, which shall apply to all local committees and members of AIESEC at all levels of membership.<br />
	<br />
	1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The possession, use or consumption of alcoholic beverages at an AIESEC event, in any situation sponsored or endorsed by AIESEC or the local committee, or in any event that an observer would associate with AIESEC, must be in compliance with any and all applicable laws of the state, province, county, city and institute of higher education, and must comply with either the BYOB or Third Party Vendor Guidelines.<br />

	<br />
	2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All alcohol consumed at any AIESEC event (which includes events organized at the local committee level), other than Third Party Vendor Events, must be purchased and brought to the event by individuals (including AIESEC members) with valid photo ID showing proof of legal drinking age at the time they enter the event.&nbsp; Under no circumstances may guests or members deliver alcohol to the event before the starting time of the event.<br />
	<br />
	3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under no circumstances may AIESEC United States or a local committee use AIESEC funds for the purchase of alcohol.&nbsp; This prohibition extends to the donation to AIESEC United States or a local committee of large quantities of alcohol by a vendor.&nbsp; AIESEC&#39;s name may not appear on an invoice or receipt for alcohol.&nbsp; Additionally, no member may coordinate the collection of funds for the purchase of alcohol.&nbsp; This means that common sources of alcohol (e.g., kegs and other large containers of alcohol) will be considered in direct violation of this Policy.<br />

	<br />
	4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Open parties, meaning those with unrestricted access by non-members of AIESEC, without specific invitation, shall be prohibited.<br />
	<br />
	5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At an AIESEC event, no member shall openly encourage or participate in &quot;drinking games.&quot;<br />
	<br />

	6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Third Party Vendor Guidelines.&nbsp; When contracting with a third party vendor in order to &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;provide services involving the serving of alcohol at an AIESEC event, the following criteria &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;should be used:<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The vendor must be properly licensed by the appropriate state and local authorities.&nbsp; This may involve both a state liquor license and a temporary license to sell on the premises where the function is to be held.<br />

	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The vendor must be insured with a minimum of $1,000,000 of general liability insurance, evidenced by a properly completed certificate of insurance prepared by its insurance provider.&nbsp; The vendor&#39;s certificate of insurance must also evidence that the vendor has, as part of its insurance coverage, &quot;off premises liquor liability coverage and non-owned and hired auto coverage.&quot;&nbsp; The named insured on the certificate of insurance must include, at a minimum, &quot;AIESEC United States&quot; and, if applicable, the name of the local committee.<br />

	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The vendor must agree, in writing, to cash sales only, collected by the vendor, during the function.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The vendor must assume, in writing, all the responsibilities that any other purveyor of alcoholic beverages would assume in the normal course of business, including, but not limited to, the following:<br />
	<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Checking ID cards upon entry;<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Not serving individuals under the applicable local legal drinking age;<br />
	<br />

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; Not serving individuals that appear to be intoxicated;<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining absolute control of all alcoholic containers present; and<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(v)&nbsp;&nbsp; Collecting all remaining alcohol at the end of a function (no excess alcohol - opened or unopened - is to be given, sold or furnished to AIESEC or any member).<br />

	<br />
	7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BYOB Guidelines.&nbsp; At any AIESEC event where alcohol is present, all members and guests that will be consuming alcoholic beverages must have photo ID showing proof of legal drinking age.&nbsp; At least one AIESEC member must remain sober at an AIESEC event where alcohol is present.&nbsp; Any AIESEC member or guest who is obviously inebriated should not be permitted to continue to consume alcohol.&nbsp; (Also see Sections 1-3).<br />
	<br />

	8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Violations of the AIESEC United States Alcohol Policy will be grounds for revocation of membership.&nbsp; Furthermore, any incident of misbehavior in connection with the use of alcohol, including, but not limited to, any violation of any laws, destruction of property or sexual or other assault will be grounds for revocation of membership.<br />
	<br />
	9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A committee comprised of the MCP, two members of the Board of Directors (one of whom shall be the Chairman of the Board of Directors), and one member of the staff of AIESEC United States will review suspected violations of the Policy and will apply appropriate sanctions.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
